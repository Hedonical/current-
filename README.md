# current-
At WHACK 2023, we built a currency exchange platform called current¢.
Current¢ gives you the current exchange rates for any two currencies as well as a graph of the last month of historic rates. Our website then allows you to check whether or not the current rate is good, about average, or bad to better inform you whether you should make a transfer now or in the future. Lastly, our app allows you to also set up notifications in case you wish to know when rates improve.
